# 📚 AuraBook Discovery: Niche Book Recommendation Engine

**AuraBook Discovery** is a modern, responsive, and data-driven web application designed to help users discover curated, high-performance books across niche self-improvement categories like Psychology, Communication, and Technology.

It features a client-side recommendation engine that personalizes content based on user engagement history, demonstrating proficiency in frontend architecture and data manipulation.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Personalized Recommendations:** A custom JavaScript algorithm tracks viewed books (stored in the browser's Local Storage) and dynamically recommends unviewed titles from the user's top two most-viewed genres.
* **Rich Filtering and Search:** Users can filter the book catalog by niche genre, minimum global rating (4.5+, 4.0+, etc.), and use a fuzzy search function to find titles by author or title.
* **Simulated Price Comparison:** Detailed book modal views include a lowest-price summary and a list of simulated prices across multiple online retailers (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart), enhancing user utility.
* **Modern UI/UX:** Features a sleek "Ultra Pro Max Dark Mode" theme with animated, responsive book cards and a focus on clean typography for an excellent reading discovery experience.
